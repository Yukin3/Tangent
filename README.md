# üß† Tangent ‚Äì AI-Enhanced Markdown Notebook

## üöÄ About the Project

**Tangent** is a web-based, Obsidian-style markdown notebook that supercharges note-taking with GenAI. It combines a clean, intuitive interface with powerful features like backlink browsing, equation assistance, and charting. With AI-assisted insights, data visualization, and knowledge linking built-in, Tangent transforms your notes into a dynamic, intelligent workspace‚Äîperfect for thinkers, tinkerers, workers, and teams alike.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

This project was inspired by the elegant and efficient user experience of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Its clean interface, powerful markdown support, and backlinking system changed the way I thought about digital note-taking. I wanted to bring that same energy to the web‚Äîwith a modern tech stack, collaborative potential, and integrated GenAI to go even further.

## üõ†Ô∏è How I Built It

Tangent was built using a full modern web stack and a collection of libraries and frameworks:

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (TSX), ShadCN UI components, `react-markdown`, framer-motion
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Auth:** Clerk
- **Visualization:** `@react-force-graph`, `three.js`
- **AI Integration:** Gemini GenAI\*

The app supports internal link tracking, rich markdown features (like math blocks), and an interactive backlink graph view to visualize the relationship between notes.

## üîç What I Learned

- Implementing a rich markdown editor with real-time rendering is harder than it looks!
- Leveraging `@react-force-graph` and `three.js` to visualize linked notes was a game-changer for UX but required digging deep into performance optimization.
- Integrating GenAI for contextual suggestions and visualizations made me rethink how AI can be a true assistant in the creative process.
- Techniques for tracking and navigating nested folder trees and references in a NRDB like MongoDB.

## üß© Challenges Faced

- **Real-Time Markdown Editing:** Rendering updates smoothly without interrupting the editing experience was tricky, especially when adding AI-generated content or visual elements like charts and math.
- **Folder Tree Navigation:** Building a scalable folder/file structure in the UI while maintaining state consistency took time and effort.
- **Link Tracking & Graph View:** Parsing markdown for internal links and building a reliable backlink graph proved complex, especially with nested references and dynamic updates.
- **File Access Authentication:** I faced challenges authenticating file access by user (or shared users) using Clerk JWT tokens, especially when ensuring secure, scoped access across sessions/devices.

## ‚úÖ Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of

- Building a full-featured markdown editor with AI-enhanced capabilities in a short timeframe.
- Successfully creating a live, interactive graph view that visualizes connections between notes and backlinks.
- Designing a clean, user-friendly UI that replicates the feel of desktop Obsidian in the browser.
- Integrating GenAI to assist with note enrichment, problem-solving, and data visualization.

## üîÆ What's Next for Tangent

- Expanding the use of GenAI to include:
  - Rendering AI-generated art directly in markdown components
  - Live web search and summarization embedded into notes
  - Smarter auto-tagging and content recommendations
- Adding real-time collaboration and syncing
- Enhancing the plugin system to allow for community-built features
- Mobile-friendly UI and offline-first support
